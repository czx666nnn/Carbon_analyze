GHG_ASSESSMENT = {
    'GHG_1': """When describing how to ensure the inventory serves decision-making needs, the focus should be on selecting appropriate emission inventory boundaries. The company should consider the following:
    1. Organizational Structure: When setting organizational boundaries, the company should choose a method for consolidating greenhouse gas emissions, which will define the company's business activities and operations and thereby calculate and report greenhouse gas emissions.
    2. Operational Boundaries: How the company identifies emissions related to its operations, distinguishes between direct and indirect emissions, and selects the accounting and reporting scope of indirect emissions.
    3. Business Scope: Whether the company considers factors such as activity type, geographic location, industry sector, information usage, and user-related factors when selecting inventory boundaries.""",
    'GHG_2': """When reporting all greenhouse gas emission sources and activities within the selected inventory boundaries, the company must disclose:
    1. Total emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2, and distinguish them from greenhouse gas trading activities such as sale, purchase, transfer, or saving of emission allowances. When reliable emission data is available, report Scope 3 emissions.
    2. Report emissions data for each scope separately.
    3. Report emission data for six types of greenhouse gases. Specify the base year and explain policies for recalculating emissions in the base year, including any significant changes that triggered recalculation.
    4. Clarify any major changes that triggered recalculations of base year emissions.
    5. Report direct carbon dioxide emissions from biogenic sources separately outside of any scope.
    6. Provide references or links to methodologies used for calculating and measuring emissions.""",
    'GHG_3': """After determining the inventory boundaries, the company generally follows these steps to calculate greenhouse gas emissions:
    1. Identify emission sources:
    First, the company should identify direct emission sources, i.e., Scope 1 emissions. Next, identify indirect emission sources resulting from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or steam (Scope 2 emissions). Afterward, identify other indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2, and emissions related to outsourcing/contract manufacturing, leasing, or franchising (Scope 3 emissions). By identifying Scope 3 emissions, the company can extend its emission inventory boundary through its value chain and identify all relevant greenhouse gas emissions.
    2. Choose emission calculation methods: The company should use the most accurate calculation methods that are feasible for its reporting situation.
    3. Collect activity data and select emission factors: In most cases, if specific emission factors are available for emission sources or facilities, these should be used instead of general emission factors.
    4. Apply calculation tools: Most companies will need to use one or more calculation tools to compute emissions from all greenhouse gas emission sources.
    5. Consolidate greenhouse gas emissions data at the company level: The company integrates greenhouse gas reporting with existing tools and processes, leveraging data collected and reported to various company departments or offices, regulatory bodies, or other stakeholders. Tools and processes for reporting data must be based on existing information and communication mechanisms (i.e., ease of integrating new data categories into the company's existing database). This also depends on specific reporting requirements set by the company's headquarters for each facility.""",
    'GHG_4': """When disclosing emission sources and activities not included, the company should specify the excluded emission sources, facilities, or operations and explain why they were considered insignificant or inapplicable. The company should also consider the relevance of other operations and whether their exclusion has a significant impact on the overall greenhouse gas emissions.""",
    'GHG_5': """The company can further subdivide emission data by business unit/facility, country, emission source type, and activity type, along with related performance ratio indicators, greenhouse gas management and reduction strategies, reasons for changes in emission levels that do not trigger recalculation of baseline emissions, information on greenhouse gas capture, facilities listed in the emission inventory, and carbon offset credits purchased or developed outside the inventory boundary. Information on reductions from emission sources within the inventory boundary, which have been sold or transferred as carbon offsets to third parties, should also be disclosed.""",
    'GHG_6': """1. Before verifying greenhouse gas emissions, the company should clearly define the verification objectives, the verification approach (such as external or internal), and the verification personnel. It should determine if this is the best way to achieve the objectives.
    2. To express their views on data or information, the verifiers should clarify whether identified errors or uncertainties are substantial.
    3. Verifiers should assess the risk of substantial deviations in each component of the greenhouse gas data collection and reporting process.
    4. Depending on the required accuracy, companies may choose to select specific key areas for internal or external verification and regularly check these areas. For example, the verification process may focus on data sources, calculation processes, and emission factors to ensure they are consistently applied.
    5. Finally, the company must disclose the verification results and confirm whether they comply with the specified accuracy requirements.""",
    'GHG_7': """The company tracks long-term emissions and needs to consider: selecting a baseline year with verifiable emissions data and clearly stating the rationale for choosing this specific year. The company must establish a recalculation policy for baseline emissions, specifying the criteria and relevant factors for recalculation. The company is responsible for determining and disclosing the "material threshold" that triggers the recalculation of baseline emissions. If any changes occur that affect the consistency and relevance of the reported greenhouse gas emissions, the baseline emissions must be recalculated retroactively. Once the company determines the policy for recalculating baseline emissions, it must apply this policy consistently.""",
    'GHG_8': """For required disclosures, the company should establish a comprehensive standard and disclose the necessary details in the report. The level of detail for selected disclosures should be determined based on the report's objectives and target audience.

However, such data can be provided to greenhouse gas emissions auditors under confidentiality agreements.""",
    'GHG_9': """The company’s greenhouse gas emissions inventory plan should include all institutional, managerial, and technical arrangements to ensure data collection, inventory preparation, and implementation quality control. The company needs to establish and implement a quality management system for the emissions inventory, which should include the following aspects:
    1. The framework of the emissions inventory plan: The company should ensure that methods, data, processes, systems, and documentation quality are maintained at each level of the inventory design.
    2. Implementing the emissions inventory quality management system: Establish an emissions inventory quality management team and develop a quality management plan. This plan should include procedures at all organizational levels and the inventory preparation process. General quality checks should be conducted, including assessing the quality of specific emission sources, reviewing final emissions data and reports, establishing formal feedback mechanisms, and specifying record-keeping procedures. The company should define what information should be recorded, how it should be archived, and what information should be reported to external stakeholders.
    3. Practical implementation measures: The company should take measures at multiple internal levels, from raw data collection to the final approval process for the emissions inventory.
    4. For specific emission sources, emissions should be calculated based on emission factors and other parameters (e.g., equipment utilization rates, oxidation rates). These factors and parameters should be based on the company’s specific operations, site characteristics, or direct emissions and other measurements. Quality checks should assess whether the emission factors and parameters represent the company’s characteristics and provide qualitative explanations for differences between measured and default values, offering reasons based on the company’s operational characteristics. The company should establish stringent data collection procedures to ensure high-quality activity level data. Estimated emissions for specific categories should be compared with historical data or other estimates to ensure they are within a reasonable range. The company should consider uncertainties in the estimation process and determine if there are solutions for model or parameter uncertainties.""",
    'GHG_10': """To account for greenhouse gas emission reductions, the company may compare actual emissions at different levels over time to meet government requirements or fulfill voluntary reduction commitments. The company should assess whether reasonable methods are used to estimate indirect reductions and should adopt project-based quantification methods to determine future offset credits. For example, it should consider baseline scenarios and emissions, additionality arguments, identification and quantification of secondary impacts, reversibility, and avoidance of double counting. The company needs to report project reduction amounts.""",
    'GHG_11': """Considerations: The company requires support and commitment from senior management, especially the board of directors or the CEO. Greenhouse gas emission targets can be classified into two categories: absolute targets and intensity targets. The company should carefully choose based on its situation and can set both. If intensity targets are adopted, the company should also report the absolute emissions related to those targets. The target boundary specifies the greenhouse gases, operational regions, emission sources, and activities covered by the target. The target boundary can be the same as the emissions inventory boundary or can specify a subset of emission sources within the inventory boundary. The company needs to select a fixed baseline year or a rolling baseline year to define target emissions against past emissions.""",
    'GHG_12': """Considerations: The company should determine whether to select a single-year commitment period or a multi-year commitment period based on its situation. It should specify whether offsets are used and how much emission reduction is achieved through offsets. The company should establish its own “target recalculation policy.” This policy should outline how to reconcile reductions, transactions related to other targets and plans, and the company’s own targets, specifying the situations where recalculation is applicable. When determining each target level, the company should consider the relationships between business metrics, the impact on its development, and whether it will affect other targets.
