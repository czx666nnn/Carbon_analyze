## Usage
Set up the environment
```shell
conda create --name carbon_analyze python=3.10
conda activate carbon_analyze 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Configure your own API key in reader.py, document.py, document.py, user_qa.py


2. Analyze a given report, for example: 2023-tesla-impact-report-highlights.pdf
```commandline
python app.py --pdf_path reports/2023-tesla-impact-report-highlights.pdf
```
- Analysis report will be stored at 2023-tesla-impact-report-highlights.html"

3. Conduct customized Question Answering
```shell
python app.py --pdf_path  reports/2023-tesla-impact-report-highlights.pdf --user_question " What key factors did the company consider when evaluating indirect reductions?" --answer_length 100
```
- user_question takes the user's question
- answer_length specifies the length of generation
